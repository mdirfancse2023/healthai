## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to assist students in managing their mental well-being. The system analyzes user inputs, detects emotional states, and provides empathetic responses using Large Language Models (LLMs) via OpenRouter.

In addition, the system tracks user interactions and visualizes emotional trends through a dashboard, enabling better awareness and decision-making. 

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop an AI-based chatbot for mental health support
* Implement emotion detection using machine learning techniques (Hugging Face)
* Provide personalized responses using LLMs
* Track and analyze user emotional patterns
* Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard
* Evaluate impact on student well-being and productivity

### 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Built a custom, zero-dependency Vector Engine using PyTorch.
* Computes dense 384-dimensional tensor embeddings locally for over 130+ academic coping mechanisms.
* Utilizes Cosine Similarity to fetch empirical coping strategies based on query meaning.

### 📊 Dashboard Analytics

* Emotion distribution (Pie Chart)
* Chat activity trend (Line Chart)
* Evaluates AI Effectiveness via user feedback tracking.
* Visual insights for Mental Health tracking (Stress vs. Academic Focus)

### 🔐 Authentication & User Accounts

* Login and signup flow backed by FastAPI + PostgreSQL
* Chats, dashboard data, feedback, and check-ins are tied to the logged-in user
* Bearer-token based frontend session handling
* Protected Chat and Dashboard routes

### 🗂️ Data Storage

* Stores chat history
* Tracks user longitudinal interactions
* Enables future personalization

### 🎨 Modern UI

* Responsive Angular frontend built with Glassmorphism 
* Fully functional Dark Mode/Light Mode toggle
* Clean navigation with Login / Sign Up in navbar for guests
* Inline form validation on invalid auth input
* Clean navigation (Chat + Dashboard) for authenticated users
* Styled components with professional layout and structured ChatGPT-style markdown rendering.

## 🚢 Deployment & CI

### GitHub Actions Deployment

The repo includes:

* [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for Docker build, push, and GKE deployment
* Workload Identity Federation for keyless GitHub Actions authentication to Google Cloud
* Immutable image rollout using `github.sha` tags during deployment

Required GitHub secrets:

* `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
* `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Qodana

The repo also includes:

* [qodana.yml](.github/workflows/qodana.yml)
* [qodana.yaml](qodana.yaml)

This setup currently keeps Qodana simple by scanning the Python backend with `qodana-python-community`.

If you want Qodana Cloud dashboard uploads, add the GitHub secret:

* `QODANA_TOKEN`

This must be the Qodana **project token** used for dashboard uploads.
